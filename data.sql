Nintendo Web Framework allows you to develop games for the Nintendo Wii U console system using HTML5 and JavaScript. The runtime uses WebKit, so we can take advantage of that by creating a game in full HTML5, then deploying it to the Wii U. This tutorial series will show you how to become a registered and licensed independent game developer (indie game dev) for Nintendo. Here you will learn to create 2D video games using JavaScript, and running it, and selling it on Nintendo\'s eShop. \r\n\r\nThe first several tutorials will walk you through the set up of the project. While this might seem a bit tedious, I do recommend that you watch through the videos so you\'ll know what my development environment is set up. All the code base is stored in a GitHub repository. Note that while some of the videos mention a Pivotal Tracker scrum project, that has been discontinued. I\'m now keeping track of my TODO tasks in a .js file within the code base itself.\r\n\r\nFinally, the bulk of the tutorials will teach you how to create a game engine (RokkoJS) using vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 APIs. We\'ll make heavy use of Google Closure tools for a very robust component based system. Once the framework is in place, we\'ll build 2D platformer games very easily and quickly. All of the rendering will be done using the canvas element, along with the CanvasRenderingContext2D. We\'ll leave 3D graphics with WebGL for a future series.

Since the Nintendo Web Framework is all about developing in straight HTML5 and JavaScript for a WebKit environment, we\'ll write the entire game using Google Chrome to test and iterate. Once we have the game complete, and you have an indie game developer or studio license with Nintendo, we\'ll just need to compile the final code base so it can be sent to Nintendo. From there, the games will be available from the eStore either for free, or at some cost if you would like to make money from Nintendo games you program.Component based game development is a way to write games in a very plug-and-play manner. Instead of gaming a very thick base class that everything in the game inherits from, and a super [poorly designed] object-oriented beast that does everything, we\'ll write very small and loose modules (components) that the various game entities can use freely. The idea is that a game entity object represents something within the game world, such as a player (the hero) or an enemy. Entities are composed of zero or more components, and each component is designed to do one thing, and one thing only. For example, an entity object can contain a render component that renders it to the screen, a movement component so we can move the entity around the game world, and a physics component so the entity follows the physics laws (logic) imposed by the component. The key point about components is that entities should be able to add and remove components at run time (as opposed to at compile time).

In this 2D JavaScript game tutorial, I\'ll explain the concept of an entity system. In modern object-oriented game development, the idea behind the entity system is that an entity is a very simple JavaScript class that represent things in the game world that can act or be interacted with. For example, in Nintendo\'s Super Mario Brothers, Mario, Luigi, a mushroom, and Bowser are all examples of entities. All the entity represents is something, somewhere in the game. Some people have the base entity class know how to do a few things on its own such as render itself or move, but normally, an entity class simply represents a location within the game space, and allows you to add and remove components to/from it. An entity is also able to update itself, which normally means it delegates control to all of its components, in act in its behalf in some way or another.Some entity classes also include some sort of query system so you can get specific components that belong to the entity, but normally each component runs only when the entity object tells them to during its update stage. As in any good object-oriented design, each component should have little to no knowledge of other components.','https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/aKhVilAlWrE/default.jpg','Hello, Nintendo Web Framework game developers!

In JavaScript game development, a component is a very simple interface that specifies that every component must be able to execute some common core method. In my game engine, every component will have a function execute(){} which, thanks to the way JavaScript method invocation works, can take whatever arguments it needs. In order to simplify things, every component in Rokko.js will take a single argument, which will be a reference to the entity that owns it. The logic behind this approach is that a component (for the most part) only exists to do something on behalf of the entity. There might be component objects that are an exception to this idea, which is totally fine. For example, the renderer component defines a timestamp parameter, which is needed by the Draw component so it is able to maintain a consistent time step. This timestamp is fed into these components by the main game loop, which is in turn a component.Remember, entities hold a collection of components, but a component can also be composed of other instances of components.','https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/lTQcJ6ogwj8/default.jpg','In this JavaScript game development tutorial using the Nintendo Web Framework, we\'ll look at the component interface.

In order to simplify things, every component in Rokko.js will take a single argument, which will be a reference to the entity that owns it. The logic behind this approach is that a component (for the most part) only exists to do something on behalf of the entity. There might be component objects that are an exception to this idea, which is totally fine. For example, the renderer component defines a timestamp parameter, which is needed by the Draw component so it is able to maintain a consistent time step. This timestamp is fed into these components by the main game loop, which is in turn a component.Remember, entities hold a collection of components, but a component can also be composed of other instances of components.','lTQcJ6ogwj8'),(54,'PLn_s5nG8UgPr8sl8msxH-lKQ9uhRE1GYfzBWSEmuZruQ','Nintendo Game Development Tutorial 11: Draw Component','2013-09-28 04:07:37','In this Nintendo Web Framework game development tutorial, we\'ll look at the draw component. In Rokko.js, the Draw component class is an abstraction over HTML5 canvas so we can draw to the screen. The execute method of this component takes an entity, a timestamp, and renders it to its CanvasRenderingContext2D. Since every entity has an (x, y) position in game space, as well as a Sprite object that graphically represents it, the draw component extracts this information from the entity, and performs the rendering of the entity object.Before we have a sprite class in place, we will simply draw each entity as a rectangle rooted at the entity\'s position, using its width and height to determine its dimensions. Later we will stop using the entity\'s size, and will instead use the width and height of the sprite that represents the image. Because of this, we\'re able to dynamically change the entity\'s size in case each sprite in the animation loop has a slightly different size.','https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/hLDFho-g7bc/default.jpg','In this Nintendo Web Framework game development tutorial, we\'ll look at the draw component.

You can start out having numbers in the array, then have elements that are strings, then Booleans, and back to strings, etc.','HuzJqqxrj3U'),(81,'PLn_s5nG8UgPpfMaYvO_FAXRodlGtK2aZinbReH6rsGMw','JavaScript Tutorial for Beginners 11: JSON Explained','2013-08-01 00:38:09','In Javascript, objects are nothing but hashes.

After the code base has been written in Java, the GWT compiler translates the code into highly optimized, browser specific Javascript, making development fast, maintenance manageable, and actual app execution a dreamy deal.For more information about GWT, check out the official website at http://www.gwtproject.org/ where you\'ll find documentation, source code repository, issues list and information related to GWT roadmap and release. It is intended for developers interested in contributing to GWT, and for keeping people informed on new and upcoming changes to GWT, GWT related events and other news.\"GWT is a development toolkit for building and optimizing complex browser-based applications. Its goal is to enable productive development of high-performance web applications without the developer having to be an expert in browser quirks, XMLHttpRequest, and JavaScript. GWT is used by many products at Google, including AdWords, AdSense, Flights, Hotel Finder, Offers, Wallet, Blogger. It\'s open source, completely free, and used by thousands of developers around the world.\"\"Productivity for developers, performance for users: GWT is a development toolkit for building and optimizing complex browser-based applications. GWT is used by many products at Google, including Google AdWords and Google Wallet. It\'s open source, completely free, and used by thousands of developers around the world.\"\"Writing web apps for multiple browsers can be a tedious and error-prone process. You can spend 90% of your time working around browser quirks. In addition, building, reusing, and maintaining large JavaScript code bases and AJAX components can be difficult and fragile.\"\"GWT (GWT) eases this burden by allowing developers to quickly build and maintain complex yet highly performant JavaScript front-end applications in the Java programming language.\"','WTJ4w-J81oE'),(139,'PLn_s5nG8UgPqqFoh8HgvE6AOZ-nohFIXNzc1LyQ_RVXQ','GWT Tutorial 2: What is Google Web Toolkit','2012-12-07 01:09:24','Google Web Toolkit (GWT) is a development toolkit for building and optimizing complex browser-based applications.

Obviously, you\'d probably want to find a happy medium, so you can maximize the code reuse.Each module has a manifest file, which is an XML file that describes the module, its styling, and whatever else it inherits. It also specifies the entry point of the module, much like an Android app, or even a regular Java or C++ application with the function main.The Java class that is assigned as the entry point class must implement the interface EntryPoint, which defines the function onModuleLoad, which is the exact entry point of all GWT modules.','https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/5i3ZoJKLR78/default.jpg','The structure of a Google Web Toolkit is simple, and pretty easy to learn and master.

Behind the scenes, if you squint your eyes, you can see the subscriber, pub/sub design pattern going on. The purpose and goal of the event bus is to decouple your application, and allow for inter-component communication. Instead, for example, of having some widget take a reference to some other widget, and manually modify that widget when it needs to (perhaps as a result of some user interaction), we could instead use the GWTEvent class to fire or broadcast an event saying that said user interaction has taken place somewhere. Then, any widgets, components, modules, views, presenters, etc., that would like to take action as a result, will be notified about it, and will be allowed to do their thing.The example in the tutorial users a button, whose click handler fires the event (a Decline event). There is a label widget that wants to know when the button is clicked, so it registers a Decline handler with the event bus. Whenever that event is fired, the label can update itself, according to the business logic that it follows.The steps to using an event bus are simple:#1. Create an event - some class that extends GwtEvent, and is typed with the event handler associated with it. Unfortunately, there are some boilerplate code in this class that is tedious, but is not a big deal.#2. Create an event handler - some interface that extends EventHandler. Here you can define the methods that a handler for the event can/must implement.#3 Instantiate an event bus - either create your own event bus by extending Event, or use one of the ready, out of the box kinds. Using SimpleEventBus is fine for most cases.#4 Pass the event bus object around so anyone can register events on it, as well as tell it to fire events as they occur.\nProgramming tutorials by Easy Learn Tutorial - because anyone can learn how to become an expert software and web developer!Copyright (c) 2013 Rodrigo Silveira - http://www.easylearntutorial.com','https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/2939gdrNymg/default.jpg','Why use an event bus: allow components to communicate throughout the app in a decoupled way.This Google Web Toolkit tutorial explains the event bus pattern.

What I wanted to accomplish in this first session was more or less the following:1. Write something that uses Angular.js functionality\n2. Get acquainted with some of the most basic and fundamental concepts of this JavaScript library\n3. Have funWhat I learned from this exercise was:1. Angular uses JavaScript constructor functions to create objects that drive HTML templates. These objects (called ngControllers) can have properties that can be rendered into the template (aka. ngView - if that\'s what they\'d call the template).2. The variable placeholder used in the view can contain some simple expressions (such as {{name + \" !! \"}} or other simple math operations and so forth. Not any arbitrary operation is accepted inside those curlies.3. You can use some inherited properties from your ngController (model data), such as .length4. You can use native JavaScript expressions/constructs inside Angular\'s template placeholders5. When you use a controller property inside an HTML attribute, don\'t include the curly braces, as you would when printing that value as part of the view.What I\'d like to learn next:1. How to functions inside the controller\n2. How to load data into controller (and from there into the view) using Ajax (XHR)\n3. How to register event listeners\n4.

This is very useful because you might not want to have to type stuff like localhost/my-project-directory just to get to your project directory. Not only is it more typing, but having a virtual host allows you to more closely match your development environment and your production environment (deployment environment). The steps to creating a virtual host are easy, and about the same in Microsoft Windows, as in any other operating system (Apple\'s Mac OS, Linux, Ubuntu, Debian, etc.). All you need to do is edit your system\'s host file (no extension, typically), then edit your server\'s config file. In WAMP, this will be Apache\'s httpd.config file. You can either edit that file directly to set up your alias, or you can create a separate alias.config file, and have the specific project configurations there.','https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/cZ9FU7x97qw/default.jpg','This video tutorial teaches you how to create your own virtual hosts in Windows, so you can have your own domain name (for free, of course), when working on your localhost.
