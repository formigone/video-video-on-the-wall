Video Video on the wall
=======================

An eye-candy website template focused on video content. Includes YouTube playlist importer. 


Purpose
-------

My goal with this application is to simplify marketing efforts and discoverability of one's video collection - particularly one's YouTube collection. Although YouTube is the second most used search engine in the world, thus making videos hosted there highly visible, you, as the publisher of video content might still need other ways to market and distribute your content. By having a separate website where you can drive traffic to, then carefully guide your visitors through a quality experience, and hopefully converting them from visitor to consumer, your chances of success go up exponentially.

In summary, this project is intended to be a very simple and straight forward application where a user can be taken to in isolation, and your best content can be presented to him or her without the added noise and distraction provided by YouTube and other video websites.


Requirements
------------

This application is built atop CodeIgniter - a very simple, yet powerful PHP model-view-controller framework. Thus, you will need:

1. PHP 5.3+
2. CodeIgniter (version 2.1 bundled)
3. MySQL

The project also uses [bundled] Twitter Bootstrap 3 (CSS framework) and jQuery 1.10 (JavaScript abstraction).
